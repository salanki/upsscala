========

An implementation of the UPS WebService [Shipping API](https://www.ups.com/upsdeveloperkit/downloadresource?loc=en_US) using [ScalaXB](http://scalaxb.org/) and the Play async webservice client.

It gives an implementation on how to handle packages, get rates and also generate and display shipping labels.

If you are only interested in figuring out how to get [ScalaXB](http://scalaxb.org/) to use the Play webservice client you will want to jump to: [app/com/ups/ship/soap11_play.scala](https://github.com/salanki/upsscala/blob/master/app/com/ups/ship/soap11_play.scala)
